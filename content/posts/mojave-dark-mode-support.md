## Medias queries

### Quick explanation

Medias queries are used in CSS to add some specific style depends on browser behavior.

For example, you can add CSS properties when the browser is at some breakpoint. In this case, it can be very useful to make your website responsive by resizing elements in the page.

### The `prefers-color-scheme` media query

This media query will detect user preferences about his current theme. It can be completed by a parameter :

| Parameters      | Description                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `no-preference` | User did not specified a theme |
| `light`         | User specified the light theme |
| `dark`          | User specified the dark theme  |

## Snippet

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background: #2f2f2f;
    color: #ffffff;
  }
}
```

In this example, we will change `body` background color and text color when user specified the dark theme.
